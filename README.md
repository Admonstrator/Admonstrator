<h2 style="text-decoration: none;">About myself</h2>
<!-- Personal -->
<img src="https://singleton-factory.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/profile-pictures-aaron.png" width="175" height="175" align="right" alt="Profile Picture" style="border-radius: 50%;">

Even though I was never good at school (greetings to my Latin and Ancient Greek teachers!) I have discovered the field of IT for myself. What started with a Microsoft FrontPage '97 website now ends with a GitHub profile. Could have been worse. 15 years of experience so far, mostly Windows but sometimes Linux as well.

What else do you need to know about me? I love seals 🦭 and possums (emoji missing!), am always very direct in my communication and happy to help whenever possible.

I love freedom, privacy and security - which doesn't necessarily mean that I ignore all big companies. I just try to be aware of what I am doing and what the consequences might be.

## Stop the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦

I am not Ukrainian myself but my wife is. We have family and friends in Ukraine and are deeply concerned about the current situation. If you can afford it, please consider donating to the [Ukraine's defenders](https://war.ukraine.ua/donate/). 

There are plenty of charities you can donate to - if you don't want to donate to the military. Every little bit helps! 🙏

## Questions about GL.iNet devices?

If you have any questions about GL.iNet devices or OpenWrt in general, feel free to contact me on the [GL.iNet forum](https://forum.gl-inet.com/u/admon/summary) - where I volunteer as a technical support moderator.
